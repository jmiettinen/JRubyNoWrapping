JRuby seems to forget wrapping Java objects to Ruby objects from time to time.
Run rake or rake bug:run to compile & run the test-case.
After some time (a few seconds usually) line "After XX iterations, constructed object has class Java::FooDeep::Row instead of Job"
should appear signifying that we did not get Ruby-wrapped object.
